Qumulo provides the most agile cloud solution for organizations that produce petabytes of file data including media and entertainment, life sciences, automotive, manufacturing, healthcare, retail, oil and gas, and  government. These types of organizations produce large volumes of file-based data that needs to be processed, analyzed and shared. Using Qumulo Shift for AWS A3, customers can copy data from any Qumulo cluster—whether on-prem or already running in a choice of clouds—to Amazon’s Simple Storage Service cloud object store (AWS S3), making it easy to take advantage of thousands of AWS cloud services and applications.
